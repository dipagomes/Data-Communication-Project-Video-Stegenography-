# Data-Communication-Project-Video-Stegenography-

A Highly Secure Video Steganography using Hamming Code<br>

A secure video steganography has been proposed here based on 
the Hamming code concepts. The steganography scheme used frames as 
still images. It divides the video stream into frames and then converts the 
frames to the YUV format.
